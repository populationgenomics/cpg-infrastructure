# We disable the following inspections:
# 1. F541: f-string is missing placeholders (we allow f-strings that don't do
#    any formatting for consistent looks and for future safety)
# 2. Inspections incompatible with Black (see https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/compatible_configs.md#why-those-options-above-1):
#    E203: whitespace before ':'
# 3. Q003 ("Change outer quotes to avoid escaping inner quotes")
# 4. B008 Do not perform function calls in argument defaults. (It's a FastAPI thing for File uploads, and Depends)
