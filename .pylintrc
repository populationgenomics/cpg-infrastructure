# We disable the following inspections:
# 1. f-string-without-interpolation (we allow f-strings that don't do any
#    formatting for consistent looks and for future safety)
# 2. logging-fstring-interpolation ("Use lazy % formatting in logging functions")
# 3. inherit-non-class ("Inheriting 'NamedTuple', which is not a class" false
#    positive, see: https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/3876)
# 4. too-few-public-methods (produces false positives)
# 5. fixme (left 'TODO' lines)
# 6. line-too-long
# 7. too-many-statements
# 8. too-many-lines
# 9. R0801 (duplicate-code)
# 10. similar lines
